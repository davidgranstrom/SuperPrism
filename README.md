SuperPrism
==========

Audio diffusion engine for SuperCollider.

SuperPrism was developed with high-density asymmetric speaker arrays in mind, but could be used for any type of setup with discrete speaker/channel assignments.

This project was created during a residency at IAC Malm√∂ which was funded by EMS.

Features
--------

* Supports multichannel file input

* Flexible routing scheme
    - Define lists of hardware outputs to create groups of speakers
    - Local FX chains for each speaker group

* Supports custom "diffuser" effects
    - A diffuser is a standard SynthDef which follows a certain I/O scheme (explained below)

* 3-band (low, mid, high) amplitude analysis for sidechain of effect parameters

* Includes a template controller class written for [NanoKONTROL2](https://github.com/davidgranstrom/NanoKontrol2)

Routing scheme
--------------

SuperPrism was designed for high-density speaker arrays. It combines a range of speakers into isolated "diffuser groups" which can be routed through user defined effects. The diffuser groups can contain any number of effects which are assigned locally to each group. This makes custom effect chains possible with dry/wet controls both for individual effects and also for the entire diffuser group.

How to define custom diffusers
------------------------------

Diffusers are synths intended to do processing on a individual speakers. Take a look at the function `newDiffuser` in `diffusers.scd`. The name should correspond to a SynthDef, and you would also need to specify a target group. Groups are defined in `main.scd`. If needed you should also create control buses to be able to set the effect parameter and store them between invocations. (The process of adding new diffusers could be automated in the future if needed). 

### I/O Scheme

A diffuser SynthDef should have exactly 1 input and 1 output. Use `XOut.ar` to route the output and define one argument named `drywet` to control the dryness/wetness of the effect and one argument called `bus` which will provide the input/output signal. drywet = 0 would simply bypass the effect (without freeing the synth). Take a look at the existing SynthDefs in `synthdefs.scd` for examples.
